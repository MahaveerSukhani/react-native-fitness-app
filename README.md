  <h2 align="center">React Native Fitness App</h2>

In this project, I have created a Fitness App.  
 The project is built using Expo, React Native, and React Navigation.  
 This app helps users follow guided workout plans with progress tracking.

## Get Started

install dev dependencies

### `npm install`

## Then

Run The App

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
